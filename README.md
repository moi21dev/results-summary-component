## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this project I moved my first steps towards:
- Flexbox
- Linear Gradient
- Media queries
- Responsive design

### Continued development

I defenitely want to learn Flexbox and CSS Grid better! These tools are useful for setting the layout of the page and making it responsive. 

### Useful resources

- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This guide is useful for a quick recap on how media queries works.
